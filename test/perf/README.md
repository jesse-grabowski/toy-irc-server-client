# Performance Tests

`test.py` is a simple performance test that spawns multiple clients, connects them to the server, and measures how long it takes for each message to be delivered to all connected clients.

This test is intentionally lightweight and not particularly robust. It should be used only for basic profiling or exploratory performance checks, and not as a source of authoritative benchmarks. It is included here primarily for completeness, as I mentioned it in the project report.
